Responsive Portfolio page with Bootstrap


Added three links in navbar to direct user to three pages. Aboutme/Home, Portfolio, and Contact me. 

About me has two buttons linking to work related profiles. Contact me has a form to fill out and submitt button to email (not currently active)

Attempted to make the pages responsive to smaller screens like tablet and mobile containers. 

Home tab features a card and jumbotron. portfolio is a carousel with controls. contact features a card and a form. 

Have plans to update code 7/21/2020 in tutoring session to improve what ive missed.
